**DEV BUILD**

Everything except for the first line of this file is ignored.
This file simply exists to provide a hook for the REPL to
communicate to the user the version of Claro that they're
working with. At the time of creation, this file is really
just useful for the Riju-hosted online Claro playground since
I'd like to have a quick way of determining which version of
Claro has been deployed so far since I'm not in control of
scheduling Riju re-deployments.

This file will be automatically replaced with the latest
release version by the GitHub Action that performs continuous
integration by automating releases when creating the release
artifacts. When doing local development, the REPL will always
simply report that it's running a "**DEV BUILD**" which I
think is good enough.

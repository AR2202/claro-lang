# claro-lang

My hobby-horse programming language where I'll attempt to implement, from
scratch, everything that I dream of having in other languages. This is
likely to be forever in flux, but we'll start somewhere.

# Read the [Comprehensive User Docs](https://jasonsteving99.github.io/claro-lang/)
Please understand that these docs are a work in progress, and while they do cover the majority of the language features, there is still more to come including better examples and clearer explanations.

# Learn Claro By Example! 
Check out the [example Claro programs](https://github.com/JasonSteving99/claro-lang/tree/main/src/java/com/claro/claro_programs).

# Try it Out Online at [riju.codes/claro](https://riju.codes/claro)!
Please keep in mind that in the current state of the world, Riju is generally behind the latest state of Claro development since I don't control Riju and can't redeploy for each new commit to this repo. If you want the latest of the latest then read the below to build Claro locally. 

# Build Claro Locally!
View the [src](https://github.com/JasonSteving99/claro-lang/tree/main/src/java/com/claro), and follow the real [User Guide](https://github.com/JasonSteving99/claro-lang/tree/main/src/java/com/claro#running-claro-programs).

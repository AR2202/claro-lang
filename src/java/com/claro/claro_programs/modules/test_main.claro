# This is a demonstration that dep modules may export transitive dep module types, that the current module doesn't
# necessarily know the definition of via a direct module dep. As Claro automatically resolves types defined in
# transitive dep modules exported by direct deps, you may still pass around values of these types, and do basic things
# like check equality, store in data structures, and pass along to procedures, but you can't actually *reference the
# type by name* w/o placing a direct dep on the module exporting the type's definition.

# depended on by the current module is generally necessary when handling structured data derived from some other module.

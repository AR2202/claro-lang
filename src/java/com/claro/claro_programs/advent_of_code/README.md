Just for the sake of taking some time to appreciate how far I've somehow come in these past 2 years, this year I'm going
to try taking a stab at some of the Advent of Code challenges to see how "useful" Claro is!

I'm going in with no expectations whatsoever, because this year has really been spent on developing more advanced/nerdy
language features that arguably would be very unlikely to come up in these sorts of coding challenges. But I'm gonna
see what happens, and take lots of notes along the way to learn what I most want to add to Claro in the future. And hey,
I may end up having to make quick tweaks to Claro along the way in order to solve each problem!

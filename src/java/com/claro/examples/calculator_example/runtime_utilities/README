This package is to contain utility Java classes that are used *AT PROGRAM RUNTIME*
by generated JavaSource and by the Interpreter. This is done to isolate logic that\'s
shared by both and in order to make sure that they can reuse the exact same logical
implementations without code duplication (which would be very error prone in this
code base).

# javacup integration

Demonstrates the integration with javacup:
- the use of the `cup()` rule in the BUILD file,
- the use of the`%cup` directive in the jflex spec
- and the use of the parser generated by cup.

### Running Executable Calculator Example

`$ bazel run compiled_calculator_binary`

# Docker Hub

If at all possible you should definitely prefer running this project with Bazel from source directly, but if you can't get Bazel working you can find docker images for the binaries generated by this project at the [Docker Hub Repo "clarolang"](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/clarolang/calculator).

### Pull the Calculator Compiler Docker Image

`$ docker pull clarolang/calculator:compiler`

### Run the Compiler Over a .calculator File to Produce Compiled .java File

`$ docker run -i clarolang/calculator:compiler --silent --classname=FirstCalculator --package="" < first.calculator > FirstCalculator.java`

### Run the Compiler Over a .calculator File and Run It

`$ docker run -i clarolang/calculator:compiler --silent --classname=FirstCalculator --package="" < first.calculator > FirstCalculator.java && javac FirstCalculator.java && java FirstCalculator`

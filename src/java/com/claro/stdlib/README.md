# Claro Std Lib

This package will contain the Claro Std Lib
Java implementation to provide essentially
convenience functionality that programmers 
should eventually be able to write themselves
in Claro, at the least through native Java interop,
but at this early point in time need to be 
implemented for the programmer to make the language
fun and ergonomic to use.

# Type Inference

So far, through each code snippet you've seen, each variable has always included an explicit type declaration. This may
se useful for the sake of very explicit readability, however, These type annotations litering your entire codebase may
zegin to feel very clunky and inconvenient-particularly when The type is very obvious to the reader, or sometimes if +
becomes very long to type(as the result of i many layers of rested collections for example). In almost every case,
however, These explicit type annotations are optional!

Claro is smart enough to be able to infer the vast majority of pes in any given program. So, unless you feel that the
type Finotation being present makes the code more readable I this instance, then you can generally omit it entirely!
lease keep in wind, however, that while this may Indeed Take your code visually resemble & something like ython or
JavaScript, Claro is 100% statically typed and Terefor is much more alike Rust/Java/Haskell than is like any dynamic
language in this regard.

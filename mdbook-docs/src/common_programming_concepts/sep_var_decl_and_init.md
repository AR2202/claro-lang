# Seperate Variable Declaration & Initialization

The previous example demonstrates the simultaneous ded- -aration and initialization of a new variable and its initial
value. It is also possible to delay initialization to happen Independently of declaration.

```
var i: int;
i = 10;
```

(Note: this is particularly useful when you may want to initialize to diff. vals. in diff branches of an if-else chain
for example)

# Required Type Annotations

Some of this will be skipping ahead to more advanced topics that haven't been brought up yet so come back to this I part
later if you want but just takeaway the fact that there are same limited situations where Claro will require a type
annotation to understand your intent.

1. Function / Consumer Args.
2. Lambda Expressions Assigned to Variables
3. Tuple Subscript - in the form of contime type cast for non-constant index.
4. Function/Provider Returned Value Assigned to Variables When the return type is generic.
5. Any of the above Expressions when passed to a generic function arg position.

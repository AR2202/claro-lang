# Hello, World!

```
print("Hello, World!");
```

As you can already see from the most minimal program possible, Claro programs are not full of unneccesary bailerplate.
Every Claro program is simply a sequence of statements that are executed from top-to-bottom as if it were a "script".
You don't need to specify a "main" method" as in other languages like Java, instead, much like Python, you simply
specify a starting fille which will take control at program start.

(Note: For now, almost all Claro statements must end w/ a semicolon. I am aware that people aren't fans of this, and so
a TODO item exists to attempt removal. of semicolons from the grammar).

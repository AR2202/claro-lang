# Hello, World!

{{EX1}}

As you can already see from the most minimal program possible, Claro programs eliminate unnecessary boilerplate. Every
Claro program is simply a sequence of statements that are executed from top-to-bottom as if it were a "script". You
don't need to specify a "main" method" as in other languages like Java, instead, much like Python, you simply specify a
starting file which will execute top-down at program start.

(Note: For now, almost all Claro statements must end with a semicolon. I am aware that many people aren't fans of this,
so a TODO item exists to attempt removal of semicolons from the grammar.)

# Hello, World!

As you can already see from the most minimal program possible, Claro programs eliminate unnecessary boilerplate. Every
Claro program is simply a sequence of statements that are executed from top-to-bottom as if it were a "script". You
don't need to specify a "main" method" as in other languages like Java, instead, much like Python, you simply specify a
starting file which will execute top-down at program start.
